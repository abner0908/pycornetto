Pycornetto
Version 0.6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This interface is useless without the Cornetto database which is
NOT included in this distribution. It is available from the TST Centrale (the
Dutch HLT Agency) at the following website:
http://tst-centrale.org/nl/producten/lexica/cornetto/7-56

Software requirements:

   * Python >=2.5 available at http://www.python.org

   * The NetworkX package for creating and manipulating graphs and networks 
      available from https://networkx.lanl.gov/

Pycornetto has been tested on GNU/Linux Ubuntu and Mac OS X (Leopard) with
Python 2.5.2 and NetworkX 0.3.7, but should work on any platform supported by
Python, which includes MS Windows.

Notice that some of these software dependcies may already be available on your
system, or may be easily installed through a package manager (depending on
e.g. your Linux distribution).

   INSTALL PYCORNETTO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download the source archive in your preferred format
   (e.g. Pycornetto-0.6.tar.gz) from http://daeso.uvt.nl/pycornetto

2. Unpack (e.g. tar xvzf Pycornetto-0.6.tar.gz) in a suitable location
   (e.g. /usr/local/src)

3. Install using the command

   python setup.py install

   Normally you need to have root or administrator rights to do a system-wide
   install. For more information (alternative install locations, trouble
   shooting, etc) see "Installing Pyton Modules" at
   http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

4. Optional: remove the unpacked archive


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   PREPROCESS CORNETTO XML FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pycornetto reads two files from the Cornetto database:  

   1. cdb_lu_xxx.xml, which contains the lexical units
   2. cdb_syn_xxx.xml, which contains the synsets

where the exact filenames may differ depending on your version of
the Cornetto database.

These files are huge and keeping them in memory consumes a lot of your system's
memory. You can reduce their size by stripping those xml elements which are
irrelevant for your purposes. For a start, you can remove empty elements. This
is what the script cornetto-strip does for you. Run it like this to obtain a
stripped file:

   cornetto-strip.py cdb_lu_xxx.xml >cdb_lu_stripped.xml
   cornetto-strip.py cdb_syn_xxx.xml >cdb_syn_stripped.xml

You can strip the files to a bare minimum using the "-m minimal" command line option
of cornetto-strip.py.

Alternatively, you can use your own xml tools to strip the database files.
However, do no remove the following elements and attributes (although removing
subelements is fine), as Pycornetto crucially depends on them:

   <cdb_lu>                     c_lu_id, c_seq_nr
   <form>                       form_cat, form_spelling
   <cdb_synset>                 c_sy_id, d_synset_id
   <synonyms>
   <synonym>                    c_lu_id
   <wn_internal_relations>
   <relation>                   relation_name, target


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ADDING WORD COUNTS TO CORNETTO XML FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to use the word similarity functions, you need to add word counts
to the lexical units.

1. Download the word count list from http://daeso.uvt.nl/pycornetto

2. Unpack (e.g. tar xvzf word-counts-*.tar.gz) in a suitable location
   (e.g., in the same directory as the Cornetto xml files). This will create a
   directory wc-xxx with a file count-lemma-tag-xxx.tab, where the exact names 
   differ depending on the version of the word count list.

3. Add the word counts from the word count list:

   cornetto-add-counts.py cdb_lu_xxx.xml wc-xxx/count-lemma-tag-xxx.tab > cdb_lu_xxx_counts.xml

   This will add the attribute "count" to the <form> element of the lexical units.

4. Compute the subsumed counts for each of the lexical units:

   cornetto-add-sub-counts.py cdb_lu_xxx_counts.xml cdb_syn_xxx.xml >cdb_lu_xxx_subcounts.xml

   This will add the attribute "subcount" to the <form> element of the lexical units.   

You can use stripped or minimal versions of cdb_lu for this.

After this, you can use the SimCornet class, or start cornetto-server.py with
the "-s" command line option, to get access to the additional word similarity
functionality, as long as you remember to provide both with cdb_lu_xxx_subcounts.xml
instead of the original cdb_lu_xxx.xml.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   TESTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to the directory containing the Cornetto database files

2. Start Python

3. Import the cornetto package

   >>> from cornetto.cornet import Cornet

4. Create a Cornet instance

   >>> c = Cornet()

5. Parse the database files:

   >>> c.open("cdb_lu_stripped.xml", "cdb_syn_stripped.xml")
   
   Alternatively, you can use the file with word counts as the first argument
   (e.g. "cdb_lu_xxx_subcounts.xml").

6. Wait a long time...

7. Try some queries:

   >>> c.ask("taal")
   ['taal:noun:3', 'taal:noun:1', 'taal:noun:2']

   >>> c.ask("taal synonym")
   {'SYNONYM': ['taaluiting:noun:1']}

   >>> c.ask("taal has_hyperonym")
   {'HAS_HYPERONYM': ['medium:noun:1', 'communicatiemiddel:noun:1']}

   >>> c.ask("taal + spraak")
   ['taal:noun:2', 'ROLE_INSTRUMENT', 'spraak:noun:3']

8. Read some online help:

   >>> help(c)

   UNINSTALL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All files are normally installed in subdirectories of the root of your Python
installation (unless you choose to install in a non-standard location using
e.g. the --prefix option from the setup.py script). You can find this
common path "prefix" by running:

   python -c "import sys; print sys.prefix"

We will refer to this path as $PREFIX. Next, do the following:

   1. Delete the source code from Python's site-packages directory by removing
      the directory $PREFIX/lib/python2.5/site-packages/cornetto

   2. Remove the scripts cornetto-*.py from Python's bin or scripts
      directory $PREFIX/bin  

   3. Delete the documentation and other the shared files by removing the 
      directory $PREFIX/share/pycornetto-2.2
